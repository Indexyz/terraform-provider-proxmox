当前的路线图，要求每次更新完代码都更新路线图，列出已经完成了什么，接下来需要做什么

## 项目要求
- No legacy fallback
- Lyre audio topology is server relay only. Do not add, restore, or preserve peer mesh audio mode, peer-to-peer audio negotiation, or mesh compatibility fallbacks.
- 不要吞掉底层异常或 cause/context 链。跨运行时、reload、listener、配置源、网络/系统调用等边界记录或返回错误时，必须保留下层错误信息方便排查；Rust `anyhow` 错误进入日志时优先使用 `{err:#}` / `{error:#}` 或等价完整 context 链格式，而不是只输出最外层 `Display`。
- Ignore superpowers:using-git-worktrees

## Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.
- Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.
- Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.
- Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task—three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.
- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused _vars, re-exporting types, adding // removed comments for removed code, etc. If you are certain that something is unused, you can delete it completely.


## DO NOT OVER-DEFEND

- Only add defensive checks (null/nil/None checks, type guards, boundary validation) at true system boundaries — public API entry points that accept external, untrusted input.
- Do not add defensive checks in internal/private functions, constructors called only by your own code, or test helpers.
- Do not add defensive copies unless the data is genuinely shared across trust boundaries.
- Omitting a defensive check is not a bug — it is a deliberate signal that the caller is trusted.

## USE MODERN LANGUAGE FEATURES

- Write idiomatic code for the language version specified by the project. Do not write code that targets an older version out of habit.
- Prefer language-level constructs that reduce boilerplate: pattern matching, destructuring, algebraic data types (sealed types, tagged unions, enums with data), data classes/records/structs, and built-in concurrency primitives.
- If the language provides exhaustiveness checking (e.g., sealed types + switch, match expressions, tagged unions), use it. Compiler-enforced completeness is better than a default/else branch that hides missing cases.
- Do not manually write what the language generates for free (toString, equality, hash, serialization).

## Code Rules

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
